<t>This document presents operational, policy and security considerations for DNS
operators who choose to offer DNS Privacy services.

<t>This document also presents a framework to assist writers of DNS Privacy Policy
and Practices Statements (analogous to DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Policies
and DNSSEC Practice Statements described in <xref target="RFC6841"/>).

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>[NOTE: This document is submitted to the IETF for initial review and for
feedback on the best forum for future versions of this document.]
</t>
<t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet. Everything a user
does knowingly or unknowingly on a device connected to the Internet makes use
of the DNS. The DNS was not originally designed with strong security or
privacy mechanisms.
</t>
<t>This document provides operational guidance related to DNS over encrypted
transports.
</t>
<t>In recent years DNS resolvers which cater to a general audience of Internet
users have become more common. In the process of DNS resolving becoming at
least partially separated from general network ownership or access service
provision to users, a space has emerged for end-clients putting specific
demands on DNS resolving services, for instance on service quality and privacy
features. Operators of some resolvers may choose to enable protocols which
encrypt DNS on the wire to cater for users who are privacy conscious, and
commit to abstain from tracking or analyzing patterns of DNS requests from
individual users or groups of users or making such DNS request data available
to third-parties.
</t>
<t>Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide protection
against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has (in principle) full
visibility of the query data for each user. Therefore, a trust relationship
exists. The ability of the operator to provide a transparent, well documented,
and secure privacy service will likely serve as a major differentiating factor
for privacy conscious users.
</t>
<t>More recently the global legislative landscape with regard to personal data
collection, retention, and psuedonymization has seen significant activity
with differing requirements active in different jurisdictions. The impact of
these changes on data pertaining to the users of Internet Service Providers and
specifically DNS open resolvers is not fully understood at the time of writing.
In certain cases that these requirement may well conflict with the
IETF's end-to-end encryption principles.
</t>
<t>This document also attempts to outline options for data handling for
operators of DNS privacy services.
</t>
<t>This document also presents a framework to assist writers of DNS Privacy Policy
and Practice Statements (DPPPS). These are documents an operator can publish
outlining their operational practices and commitments with regard to privacy
providing a means for clients to evaluate the privacy properties of a given DNS
privacy service. In particular, the framework identifies the elements that
should be considered in formulating a DPPPS. It does not, however, define a
particular Policy or Practice Statement, nor does it seek to provide legal
advice or recommendations as to the contents.
</t>
<t>Community knowledge about operational practices can change quickly, and
experience shows that a Best Current Practice (BCP) document about privacy and
security is a point-in-time statement. Readers are advised to seek out any
errata or updates that apply to this document.
</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">
<t>Whilst <xref target="RFC7626"/> describes the privacy issues and risks associated
with the use of the DNS by Internet users. This document is concerned with
best practice considerations for operators providing DNS privacy services on a
Privacy-enabling DNS server. It covers the following areas (taken from
<xref target="RFC7626"/>):
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>data on the wire between a stub and a resolver</t>
<t>data &quot;at rest&quot; on a recursive server (in logs and in the cache)</t>
<t>data sent onwards from the resolver</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="documents" title="Documents">
<t>There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have either
the potential to increase or
decrease the privacy of the DNS. Note this does not imply that some documents
are good or bad, better or worse, just that some features or usages of DNS may
bring benefits at the price of a reduction in privacy. These documents are
listed in the following three sections.

<section anchor="recommendations-for-dns-privacy-services" title="Recommendations for DNS Privacy Services">

<section anchor="transport-recommendations" title="Transport recommendations">
<t>A DNS privacy service is EXPECTED to be made available over one or more of the following transports
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>DNS-over-TLS</t>
<t>DNS-over-HTTPS</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A DNS privacy service COULD also be provided over DNS-over-DTLS, IPSec, DNSCrypt or VPNs.
However, use of these transports for DNS are not standardized and any discussion of
best practice for providing such service is out of scope for ths document.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="protocol-recommendations" title="Protocol recommendations">
<t>In the case of DNS-over-TLS, TLS profiles from Section 9 and the Countermeasures
to DNS Traffic Analysis from section 11.1of <xref target="RFC8310"/> are EXPECTED to be used.
</t>
<t>DNS privacy services COULD also consider the following capabilities/options:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>QNAME minimisation <xref target="RFC7816"/></t>
<t>Management of TLS connections to optimise performance for clients using either
<list style="symbols">

<t>DNS Stateful Operations <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-session-signal"/></t>
</list></t>
<t>Clients should not be required to use TLS session resumption <xref target="RFC5077"/> or Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies <xref target="RFC7873"/></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>DNS privacy services MIGHT offer the following capabilities:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>DNS privacy service on both port 853 and 443 (to circumvent blocking of
port 853)</t>
<t>A .onion <xref target="RFC7686"/> service endpoint</t>
<t>Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache <xref target="RFC8198"/> to reduce the number of
queries to authoritative servers to increase privacy.</t>
<t>Run a copy of the root zone on loopback <xref target="RFC7706"/> to avoid making queries to
the root servers that might leak information.</t>
<t>DNS privacy service should not differ from the 'normal' DNS
service in terms of such options as filtering,
DNSSEC as they would on the providers non-encrypted service</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client-query-obfuscation" title="Client query obfuscation">
<t>Since queries from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers are performed
using cleartext (at the time of writing), resolver services need to consider the
extent to which they may be directly leaking information about their client
community via these upstream queries and what they can do to mitigate this
further. Note, that even when all the relevant techniques described above are
employed there may still be attacks possible, e.g.
<xref target="Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption"/>. For example, a resolver with a very small
community of users risks exposing data in this way and COULD obfuscate
this traffic by mixing it with 'generated' traffic to make client
characterisation harder.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="availability" title="Availability">
<t>DNS privacy services are EXPECTED be engineered for high availability. A failed
DNS privacy service could force the user to switch providers, fallback to cleartext or
accept no DNS service for the outage.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authentication-of-dns-privacy-services" title="Authentication of DNS privacy services">
<t>To enable users to select a 'Strict Privacy' usage profile
<xref target="RFC8310"/> DNS privacy services should provide
credentials in the form of either X.509 certificates, SPKI pinsets or TLSA
records. This in effect commits the DNS privacy service to a public identity
users will trust.
</t>
<t>Anecdotal evidence to date highlights this requirement as one of the more
challenging aspects of running a DNS privacy service as management of such
credentials is new to DNS operators.
</t>

<section anchor="generation-and-publication-of-certificates" title="Generation and publication of certificates">
<t>It is recommended that operators:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Choose a short, memorable authentication name for their service</t>
<t>Automate the generation and publication of certificates</t>
<t>Monitor certificates to prevent accidental expiration of certificates</t>

<section anchor="limitations-of-using-a-pure-tls-proxy" title="Limitations of using a pure TLS proxy">
<t>Some operators may choose to implement DNS-over-TLS using a TLS proxy (e.g.
<eref target="https://nginx.org/">nginx</eref>, <eref target="https://www.haproxy.org/">haproxy</eref> or
<eref target="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01386/0/DNS-over-TLS.html">stunnel</eref>) in front of
a DNS nameserver because of proven robustness and capacity when handling large
numbers of client connections, load balancing capabilities and good tooling.
Currently, however, because such proxies typically have no specific handling of
DNS as a protocol over TLS or DTLS using them can restrict traffic management at
the proxy layer and at the DNS server. For example, all traffic received by a
nameserver behind such a proxy will appear to originate from the proxy and DNS
techniques such as ACLs or RRL will be hard or impossible to implement in the
nameserver.

<section anchor="psuedonymisation-and-anonymisation-methods" title="Psuedonymisation and Anonymisation methods">
<t>There is active discussion in the space of effective psuedonymisation of
personal data in DNS query logs. To-date this has focussed on
psuedonymisation of client IP addresses, however there are as yet no
standards for this that are unencumbered by patents. This section briefly
references some known methods in this space at the time of writing.
</t>

<section anchor="ipcipher" title="ipcipher">
<t><xref target="ipcipher-spec"/> is a psuedonymisation technique which encrypts IPv4 and IPv6

IETF draft.

<section anchor="bloom-filters" title="Bloom filters">
<t>There is also on-going work in the area of using Bloom filters as a

(IOCs) originating from specific subnets without storing information about, or
be able to monitor the DNS queries of an individual user.
