<abstract>
<t>This document presents operational, policy, and security considerations for DNS
recursive resolver operators who choose to offer DNS Privacy services. With
these recommendations, the operator can make deliberate decisions regarding
which services to provide, and how the decisions and alternatives impact the
privacy of users.
</t>
<t>This document also presents a framework to assist writers of a DNS Recursive
Operator Privacy Statement (analogous to DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
Policies and DNSSEC Practice Statements described in RFC6841).

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the Internet; almost every
activity on the Internet starts with a DNS query (and often several). However
the DNS was not originally designed with strong security or privacy mechanisms.
A number of developments have taken place in recent years which aim to increase
the privacy of the DNS system and these are now seeing some deployment. This
latest evolution of the DNS presents new challenges to operators and this
document attempts to provide an overview of considerations for privacy focused
DNS services.
</t>
<t>In recent years there has also been an increase in the availability of &quot;public
resolvers&quot; <xref target="RFC8499"/> which users may prefer to use
instead of the default network resolver because they offer a specific feature
(e.g. good reachability, encrypted transport, strong privacy policy, filtering
(or lack of), etc.). These open resolvers have tended to be at the forefront of
adoption of privacy related enhancements but it is anticipated that operators of
other resolver services will follow.
</t>
<t>Whilst protocols that encrypt DNS messages on the wire provide protection
against certain attacks, the resolver operator still has (in principle) full
visibility of the query data and transport identifiers for each user. Therefore,
a trust relationship exists. The ability of the operator to provide a
transparent, well documented, and secure privacy service will likely serve as a
major differentiating factor for privacy conscious users if they make an
active selection of which resolver to use.
</t>
<t>It should also be noted that the choice of a user to configure a single resolver
(or a fixed set of resolvers) and an encrypted transport to use in all network
environments has both advantages and disadvantages. For example the user has a
clear expectation of which resolvers have visibility of their query data however
this resolver/transport selection may provide an added mechanism to track them
as they move across network environments. Commitments from operators to minimize
such tracking are also likely to play a role in user selection of resolvers.
</t>
<t>More recently the global legislative landscape with regard to personal data
collection, retention, and pseudonymization has seen significant activity.
It is an untested area that simply using a DNS resolution service
constitutes consent from the user for the operator to process their query data.
The impact of recent legislative changes on data pertaining to the users of both
Internet Service Providers and public DNS resolvers is not fully understood at the
time of writing.
</t>
<t>This document has two main goals:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>To provide operational and policy guidance related to DNS over encrypted
transports and to outline recommendations for data handling for operators of
DNS privacy services.</t>
<t>To introduce the DNS Recursive Operator Privacy (DROP) statement and present a
framework to assist writers of this document. A DROP statement is a document
that an operator can publish outlining their operational practices and
commitments with regard to privacy thereby providing a means for clients to
evaluate the privacy properties of a given DNS privacy service. In particular,
the framework identifies the elements that should be considered in formulating
a DROP statement. This document does not, however, define a particular Privacy
statement, nor does it seek to provide legal advice or recommendations as to
the contents.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A desired operational impact is that all operators (both those providing
resolvers within networks and those operating large public services) can
demonstrate their commitment to user privacy thereby driving all DNS resolution
services to a more equitable footing. Choices for users would (in this ideal
world) be driven by other factors e.g. differing security policies or minor
difference in operator policy rather than gross disparities in privacy concerns.
</t>
<t>Community insight [or judgment?] about operational practices can change
quickly, and experience shows that a Best Current Practice (BCP) document about
privacy and security is a point-in-time statement. Readers are advised to seek
out any errata or updates that apply to this document.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">
<t>&quot;DNS Privacy Considerations&quot; <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-rfc7626-bis"/> describes the
general privacy issues and threats associated with the use of the DNS by
Internet users and much of the threat analysis here is lifted from that
document and from <xref target="RFC6973"/>. However this document is limited in scope to best
practice considerations for the provision of DNS privacy services by servers
(recursive resolvers) to clients (stub resolvers or forwarders). Privacy
considerations specifically from the perspective of an end user, or those for
operators of authoritative nameservers are out of scope.
</t>
<t>This document includes (but is not limited to) considerations in the following
areas (taken from <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-rfc7626-bis"/>):
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Data &quot;on the wire&quot; between a client and a server.</t>
<t>Data &quot;at rest&quot; on a server (e.g. in logs).</t>
<t>Data &quot;sent onwards&quot; from the server (either on the wire or shared with a
third party).</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Whilst the issues raised here are targeted at those operators who choose to
offer a DNS privacy service, considerations for areas 2 and 3 could equally
apply to operators who only offer DNS over unencrypted transports but who would
like to align with privacy best practice.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy-related-documents" title="Privacy related documents">
<t>There are various documents that describe protocol changes that have the
potential to either increase or decrease the privacy of the DNS. Note this does
not imply that some documents are good or bad, better or worse, just that (for
example) some features may bring functional benefits at the price of a reduction
in privacy and conversely some features increase privacy with an accompanying
increase in complexity. A selection of the most relevant documents are listed in
<xref target="documents"/> for reference.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/>
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
</t>
<t>DNS terminology is as described in <xref target="RFC8499"/> with one modification: we restate
the clause in the original definition of Privacy-enabling DNS server in
<xref target="RFC8310"/> to include the requirement that a DNS over (D)TLS server should also
offer at least one of the credentials described in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8310"/> and
implement the (D)TLS profile described in Section 9 of <xref target="RFC8310"/>.

</t>
</section>

<section anchor="recommendations-for-dns-privacy-services" title="Recommendations for DNS privacy services">
<t>We describe two classes of threats:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Threats described in <xref target="RFC6973"/> 'Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols'
<list style="symbols">
<t>Privacy terminology, threats to privacy, and mitigations as described in
Sections 3, 5, and 6 of <xref target="RFC6973"/>.</t>
</list></t>
<t>DNS Privacy Threats
<list style="symbols">
<t>These are threats to the users and operators of DNS privacy services that
are not directly covered by <xref target="RFC6973"/>. These may be more operational in
nature such as certificate management or service availability issues.</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>We describe three classes of actions that operators of DNS privacy
services can take:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Threat mitigation for well understood and documented privacy threats to the
users of the service and in some cases to the operators of the service.</t>
<t>Optimization of privacy services from an operational or management perspective.</t>
<t>Additional options that could further enhance the privacy and usability of the
service.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This document does not specify policy - only best practice, however for DNS
Privacy services to be considered compliant with these best practice guidelines
they SHOULD implement (where appropriate) all:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Threat mitigations to be minimally compliant.</t>
<t>Optimizations to be moderately compliant.</t>
<t>Additional options to be maximally compliant.</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="on-the-wire-between-client-and-server" title="On the wire between client and server">
<t>In this section we consider both data on the wire and the service provided to
the client.
</t>

<section anchor="transport-recommendations" title="Transport recommendations">
<t><xref target="RFC6973"/> Threats:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Surveillance:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Passive surveillance of traffic on the wire
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-rfc7626-bis"/> Section 2.4.2.</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>DNS Privacy Threats:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Active injection of spurious data or traffic.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>A DNS privacy service can mitigate these threats by providing service over one
or more of the following transports
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>DNS-over-TLS <xref target="RFC7858"/> and <xref target="RFC8310"/>.</t>
<t>DoH <xref target="RFC8484"/>.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>It is noted that a DNS privacy service can also be provided over DNS-over-DTLS
<xref target="RFC8094"/>, however this is an Experimental specification and there are no known
implementations at the time of writing.
</t>
<t>It is also noted that DNS privacy service might be provided over IPSec, DNSCrypt,
or VPNs. However, use of these transports for DNS are not standardized and any
discussion of best practice for providing such a service is out of scope for
this document.
</t>
<t>Whilst encryption of DNS traffic can protect against active injection this does
not diminish the need for DNSSEC, see <xref target="dnssec"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authentication-of-dns-privacy-services" title="Authentication of DNS privacy services">
<t><xref target="RFC6973"/> Threats:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Surveillance:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Active attacks that can redirect traffic to rogue servers
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-rfc7626-bis"/> Section 2.5.3.</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>DNS privacy services should ensure clients can authenticate the server. Note
that this, in effect, commits the DNS privacy service to a public identity users
will trust.
</t>
<t>When using DNS-over-TLS clients that select a 'Strict Privacy' usage profile
<xref target="RFC8310"/> (to mitigate the threat of active attack on the client) require the
ability to authenticate the DNS server. To enable this, DNS privacy services
that offer DNS-over-TLS should provide credentials in the form of either X.509
certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/> or Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) pin sets <xref target="RFC8310"/>.
</t>
<t>When offering DoH <xref target="RFC8484"/>, HTTPS requires authentication of the server as
part of the protocol.
</t>

<section anchor="certificate-management" title="Certificate management">
<t>Anecdotal evidence to date highlights the management of certificates as one of
the more challenging aspects for operators of traditional DNS resolvers that
choose to additionally provide a DNS privacy service as management of such
credentials is new to those DNS operators.
</t>
<t>It is noted that SPKI pin set management is described in <xref target="RFC7858"/> but that key
pinning mechanisms in general have fallen out of favor operationally for
various reasons such as the logistical overhead of rolling keys.
</t>
<t>DNS Privacy Threats:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Invalid certificates, resulting in an unavailable service.</t>
<t>Mis-identification of a server by a client e.g. typos in URLs or
authentication domain names <xref target="RFC8310"/>.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>It is recommended that operators:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Follow the guidance in Section 6.5 of <xref target="RFC7525"/> with regards to certificate
revocation.</t>
<t>Automate the generation, publication, and renewal of certificates. For example,
ACME <xref target="RFC8555"/> provides a mechanism to actively manage certificates through
automation and has been implemented by a number of certificate authorities.</t>
<t>Monitor certificates to prevent accidental expiration of certificates.</t>
<t>Choose a short, memorable authentication name for the service.</t>

<t>Implementing EDNS(0) Padding <xref target="RFC7830"/> using the guidelines in
<xref target="RFC8467"/> or a successor specification.</t>
<t>Servers should not degrade in any way the query service level provided to
clients that do not use any form of session resumption mechanism, such as TLS
session resumption <xref target="RFC5077"/> with TLS 1.2, section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC8446"/>, or Domain

</t>
<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>All DNS privacy services must offer a DNS privacy service that performs Domain
Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation. In addition they must be
able to provide the DNSSEC RRs to the client so that it can perform its own
validation.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The addition of encryption to DNS does not remove the need for DNSSEC
<xref target="RFC4033"/> - they are independent and fully compatible protocols,
each solving different problems. The use of one does not diminish the need nor
the usefulness of the other.
</t>
<t>While the use of an authenticated and encrypted transport protects origin
authentication and data integrity between a client and a DNS privacy service it
provides no proof (for a non-validating client) that the data provided by the
DNS privacy service was actually DNSSEC authenticated. As with cleartext DNS the
user is still solely trusting the AD bit (if present) set by the resolver.
</t>
<t>It should also be noted that the use of an encrypted transport for DNS actually
solves many of the practical issues encountered by DNS validating clients e.g.
interference by middleboxes with cleartext DNS payloads is completely avoided.
In this sense a validating client that uses a DNS privacy service which supports
DNSSEC has a far simpler task in terms of DNSSEC Roadblock avoidance <xref target="RFC8027"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="availability" title="Availability">
<t>DNS Privacy Threats:

<t>
<list style="symbols">

fallback to cleartext or accept no DNS service for the outage.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>A DNS privacy service should strive to engineer encrypted services to the same
availability level as any unencrypted services they provide. Particular care
should to be taken to protect DNS privacy services against denial-of-service
attacks, as experience has shown that unavailability of DNS resolving because of
attacks is a significant motivation for users to switch services. See, for
example Section IV-C of <xref target="Passive-Observations-of-a-Large-DNS"/>.
</t>
<t>Techniques such as those described in Section 10 of [RFC7766] can be of use to operators to defend against such attacks.

<t>A DNS privacy service should deliver the same level of service as offered on

</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Increased use of encryption impacts operator ability to manage their network <xref target="RFC8404"/>.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Many monitoring solutions for DNS traffic rely on the plain text nature of
this traffic and work by intercepting traffic on the wire, either using a
separate view on the connection between clients and the resolver, or as a
separate process on the resolver system that inspects network traffic. Such
solutions will no longer function when traffic between clients and resolvers is
encrypted. There are, however, legitimate reasons for operators to inspect DNS
traffic, e.g. to monitor for network security threats. Operators may therefore
need to invest in alternative means of monitoring that relies on either the
resolver software directly, or exporting DNS traffic from the resolver using
e.g. <xref target="dnstap"/>.
</t>
<t>Optimization:
</t>
<t>When implementing alternative means for traffic monitoring, operators of a DNS
privacy service should consider using privacy conscious means to do so (see
section <xref target="data-at-rest-on-the-server"/> for more details on data handling and also
the discussion on the use of Bloom Filters in <xref target="ip-address-techniques"/>.

<list style="symbols">
<t>Limited ability to manage or monitor incoming connections using DNS specific

<t>Misconfiguration of the target server could lead to data leakage if the proxy

</list>
</t>
<t>Optimization:
</t>
<t>Some operators may choose to implement DNS-over-TLS using a TLS proxy (e.g.
<xref target="nginx"/>, <xref target="haproxy"/>, or
<xref target="stunnel"/>) in front of
a DNS nameserver because of proven robustness and capacity when handling large
numbers of client connections, load balancing capabilities and good tooling.
Currently, however, because such proxies typically have no specific handling of
DNS as a protocol over TLS or DTLS using them can restrict traffic management at
the proxy layer and at the DNS server. For example, all traffic received by a
nameserver behind such a proxy will appear to originate from the proxy and DNS
techniques such as ACLs, RRL, or DNS64 will be hard or impossible to implement in
the nameserver.
</t>
<t>Operators may choose to use a DNS aware proxy such as
<xref target="dnsdist"/> which offers custom options (similar to that
proposed in <xref target="I-D.bellis-dnsop-xpf"/>) to add source information to packets
to address this shortcoming. It should be noted that such options potentially
significantly increase the leaked information in the event of a
misconfiguration.

<section anchor="data-minimization-of-network-traffic" title="Data minimization of network traffic">
<t>Data minimization refers to collecting, using, disclosing, and storing the
minimal data necessary to perform a task, and this can be achieved by
removing or obfuscating privacy-sensitive information in network traffic logs.
This is typically personal data, or data that can be used to link a record to an
individual, but may also include revealing other confidential information, for
example on the structure of an internal corporate network.
</t>
<t>The problem of effectively ensuring that DNS traffic logs contain no or minimal
privacy-sensitive information is not one that currently has a generally agreed
solution or any standards to inform this discussion. This section presents an
overview of current techniques to simply provide reference on the current
status of this work.
</t>
<t>Research into data minimization techniques (and particularly IP address
pseudonymization/anonymization) was sparked in the late 1990s/early 2000s,
partly driven by the desire to share significant corpuses of traffic captures
for research purposes. Several techniques reflecting different requirements in
this area and different performance/resource tradeoffs emerged over the course
of the decade. Developments over the last decade have been both a blessing and a
curse; the large increase in size between an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, for
example, renders some techniques impractical, but also makes available a much
larger amount of input entropy, the better to resist brute force
re-identification attacks that have grown in practicality over the period.
</t>
<t>Techniques employed may be broadly categorized as either anonymization or
pseudonymization. The following discussion uses the definitions from <xref target="RFC6973"/>
Section 3, with additional observations from <xref target="van-Dijkhuizen-et-al."/>
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Anonymization. To enable anonymity of an individual, there must exist a set of
individuals that appear to have the same attribute(s) as the individual. To
the attacker or the observer, these individuals must appear indistinguishable
from each other.</t>
<t>Pseudonymization. The true identity is deterministically replaced with an
alternate identity (a pseudonym). When the pseudonymization schema is known,
the process can be reversed, so the original identity becomes known again.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>In practice there is a fine line between the two; for example, how to categorize
a deterministic algorithm for data minimization of IP addresses that produces a
group of pseudonyms for a single given address.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ip-address-pseudonymization-and-anonymization-methods" title="IP address pseudonymization and anonymization methods">
<t>As <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-rfc7626-bis"/> makes clear, the big privacy risk in
DNS is connecting DNS queries to an individual and the major vector for this in
DNS traffic is the client IP address.
</t>
<t>There is active discussion in the space of effective pseudonymization of IP
addresses in DNS traffic logs, however there seems to be no single solution that
is widely recognized as suitable for all or most use cases. There are also as
yet no standards for this that are unencumbered by patents.
</t>
<t>The following table presents a high level comparison of various techniques
employed or under development in 2019 and classifies them according to
categorization of technique and other properties. <xref target="ip-address-techniques"/>
provides a more detailed survey of these techniques and definitions for the
categories and properties listed below. The list of techniques includes the main
techniques in current use, but does not claim to be comprehensive.

</t>
<t>The choice of which method to use for a particular application will depend on
the requirements of that application and consideration of the threat analysis of
the particular situation.
</t>
<t>For example, a common goal is that distributed packet captures must be in an
existing data format such as PCAP <xref target="pcap"/> or C-DNS
<xref target="RFC8618"/> that can be used as input to existing
analysis tools. In that case, use of a format-preserving technique is
essential. This, though, is not cost-free - several authors (e.g. <xref target="Brenker-and-Arnes"/>
have observed that, as the entropy in an IPv4 address is limited, given
a de-identified log from a target, if an attacker is capable of ensuring
packets are captured by the target and the attacker can send forged traffic
with arbitrary source and destination addresses to that target, any
format-preserving pseudonymization is vulnerable to an attack along the lines
of a cryptographic chosen plaintext attack.

<t>Mitigations:
</t>
<t>As specified in <xref target="RFC8310"/> for DNS-over-TLS but applicable to any DNS Privacy
services the server should:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Implement QNAME minimization <xref target="RFC7816"/>.</t>
<t>Honor a SOURCE PREFIX-LENGTH set to 0 in a query containing the EDNS(0)
Client Subnet (ECS) option and not send an ECS option in upstream queries.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Optimizations:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>The server should either:
<list style="symbols">
<t>not use the ECS option in upstream queries at all, or</t>
<t>offer alternative services, one that sends ECS and one that does not.</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>If operators do offer a service that sends the ECS options upstream they should
use the shortest prefix that is operationally feasible and ideally
use a policy of whitelisting upstream servers to send ECS to in order to
minimize data leakage. Operators should make clear in any policy statement what
prefix length they actually send and the specific policy used.
</t>
<t>Whitelisting has the benefit that not only does the operator know which upstream
servers can use ECS but also allows the operator to decide which upstream
servers apply privacy policies that the operator is happy with. However some
operators consider whitelisting to incur significant operational overhead
compared to dynamic detection of ECS on authoritative servers.
</t>
<t>Additional options:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache <xref target="RFC8198"/> and <xref target="RFC8020"/>
(NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing Underneath) to reduce the number of queries
to authoritative servers to increase privacy.</t>
<t>Run a copy of the root zone on loopback <xref target="RFC7706"/> to avoid making queries to
the root servers that might leak information.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client-query-obfuscation" title="Client query obfuscation">
<t>Additional options:
</t>
<t>Since queries from recursive resolvers to authoritative servers are performed
using cleartext (at the time of writing), resolver services need to consider the
extent to which they may be directly leaking information about their client
community via these upstream queries and what they can do to mitigate this
further. Note, that even when all the relevant techniques described above are
employed there may still be attacks possible, e.g.
<xref target="Pitfalls-of-DNS-Encryption"/>. For example, a resolver with a very small
community of users risks exposing data in this way and OUGHT obfuscate this
traffic by mixing it with 'generated' traffic to make client characterization
harder. The resolver could also employ aggressive pre-fetch techniques as a
further measure to counter traffic analysis.
</t>
<t>At the time of writing there are no standardized or widely recognized techniques
to perform such obfuscation or bulk pre-fetches.
</t>
<t>Another technique that particularly small operators may consider is forwarding
local traffic to a larger resolver (with a privacy policy that aligns with their
own practices) over an encrypted protocol so that the upstream queries are
obfuscated among those of the large resolver.

<t>Operators should not provide identifiable data to third-parties without explicit
consent from clients (we take the stance here that simply using the resolution
service itself does not constitute consent).
</t>
<t>Operators should consider including specific guidelines for the collection of
aggregated and/or anonymized data for research purposes, within or outside of
their own organization. This can benefit not only the operator (through
inclusion in novel research) but also the wider Internet community. See the policy published by SURFnet <xref target="SURFnet-policy"/> on data sharing for research as

<section anchor="ip-address-techniques" title="IP address techniques">
<t>Data minimization methods may be categorized by the processing used and the
properties of their outputs. The following builds on the categorization
employed in <xref target="RFC6235"/>:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Format-preserving. Normally when encrypting, the original data length and
patterns in the data should be hidden from an attacker. Some applications of
de-identification, such as network capture de-identification, require that the
de-identified data is of the same form as the original data, to allow the data
to be parsed in the same way as the original.</t>
<t>Prefix preservation. Values such as IP addresses and MAC addresses contain
prefix information that can be valuable in analysis, e.g. manufacturer ID in
MAC addresses, subnet in IP addresses. Prefix preservation ensures that
prefixes are de-identified consistently; e.g. if two IP addresses are from the
same subnet, a prefix preserving de-identification will ensure that their
de-identified counterparts will also share a subnet. Prefix preservation may
be fixed (i.e. based on a user selected prefix length identified in advance to
be preserved ) or general.</t>
<t>Replacement. A one-to-one replacement of a field to a new value of the same
type, for example using a regular expression.</t>
<t>Filtering. Removing (and thus truncating) or replacing data in a field. Field
data can be overwritten, often with zeros, either partially (grey marking) or
completely (black marking).</t>
<t>Generalization. Data is replaced by more general data with reduced
specificity. One example would be to replace all TCP/UDP port numbers with one
of two fixed values indicating whether the original port was ephemeral
(&gt;=1024) or non-ephemeral (&gt;1024). Another example, precision degradation,
reduces the accuracy of e.g. a numeric value or a timestamp.</t>
<t>Enumeration. With data from a well-ordered set, replace the first data item
data using a random initial value and then allocate ordered values for
subsequent data items. When used with timestamp data, this preserves ordering
but loses precision and distance.</t>
<t>Reordering/shuffling. Preserving the original data, but rearranging its order,
often in a random manner.</t>
<t>Random substitution. As replacement, but using randomly generated replacement
values.</t>
<t>Cryptographic permutation. Using a permutation function, such as a hash
function or cryptographic block cipher, to generate a replacement
de-identified value.

<section anchor="google-analytics-nonprefix-filtering" title="Google Analytics non-prefix filtering">
<t>Since May 2010, Google Analytics has provided a facility <xref target="IP-Anonymization-in-Analytics"/> that allows website
owners to request that all their users IP addresses are anonymized within
Google Analytics processing. This very basic anonymization simply sets to zero
the least significant 8 bits of IPv4 addresses, and the least significant 80
bits of IPv6 addresses. The level of anonymization this produces is perhaps
questionable. There are some analysis results <xref target="Geolocation-Impact-Assessement"/>
which suggest that the impact of
this on reducing the accuracy of determining the user's location from their IP
address is less than might be hoped; the average discrepancy in identification
of the user city for UK users is no more than 17%.
</t>
<t>Anonymization: Format-preserving, Filtering (grey marking).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dnswasher" title="dnswasher">
<t>Since 2006, PowerDNS have included a de-identification tool <xref target="dnswasher"/> with
their PowerDNS product. This is a PCAP filter that performs a one-to-one mapping
of end user IP addresses with an anonymized address. A table of user IP
addresses and their de-identified counterparts is kept; the first IPv4 user
addresses is translated to 0.0.0.1, the second to 0.0.0.2 and so on. The
de-identified address therefore depends on the order that addresses arrive in
the input, and running over a large amount of data the address translation
tables can grow to a significant size.
</t>
<t>Anonymization: Format-preserving, Enumeration.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="prefixpreserving-map" title="Prefix-preserving map">
<t>Used in <xref target="TCPdpriv"/>,
this algorithm stores a set of original and anonymised IP
address pairs. When a new IP address arrives, it is compared with previous
addresses to determine the longest prefix match. The new address is anonymized
by using the same prefix, with the remainder of the address anonymized with a
random value. The use of a random value means that TCPdrpiv is not
deterministic; different anonymized values will be generated on each run. The
need to store previous addresses means that TCPdpriv has significant and
unbounded memory requirements, and because of the need to allocated anonymized
addresses sequentially cannot be used in parallel processing.
</t>
<t>Anonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="cryptographic-prefixpreserving-pseudonymization" title="Cryptographic Prefix-Preserving Pseudonymization">
<t>Cryptographic prefix-preserving pseudonymization was originally proposed as an
improvement to the prefix-preserving map implemented in TCPdpriv, described in
<xref target="Xu-et-al."/> and implemented in the <xref target="Crypto-PAn"/> tool.
Crypto-PAn is now frequently
used as an acronym for the algorithm. Initially it was described for IPv4
addresses only; extension for IPv6 addresses was proposed in <xref target="Harvan"/>. This uses a cryptographic algorithm
rather than a random value, and thus pseudonymity is determined uniquely by the
encryption key, and is deterministic. It requires a separate AES encryption for
each output bit, so has a non-trivial calculation overhead. This can be
mitigated to some extent (for IPv4, at least) by pre-calculating results for
some number of prefix bits.
</t>
<t>Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="tophash-subtreereplicated-anonymization" title="Top-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymization">
<t>Proposed in <xref target="Ramaswamy-and-Wolf"/>,
Top-hash Subtree-replicated Anonymization (TSA)
originated in response to the requirement for faster processing than Crypto-PAn.
It used hashing for the most significant byte of an IPv4 address, and a
pre-calculated binary tree structure for the remainder of the address. To save
memory space, replication is used within the tree structure, reducing the size
of the pre-calculated structures to a few Mb for IPv4 addresses. Address
pseudonymization is done via hash and table lookup, and so requires minimal
computation. However, due to the much increased address space for IPv6, TSA is
not memory efficient for IPv6.
</t>
<t>Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, prefix preservation (general).
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="ipcipher" title="ipcipher">
<t>A recently-released proposal from PowerDNS, ipcipher
<xref target="ipcipher1"/> <xref target="ipcipher2"/>  is a simple
pseudonymization technique for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses are
encrypted directly with AES-128 using a key (which may be derived from a
passphrase). IPv4 addresses are similarly encrypted, but using a recently
proposed encryption <xref target="ipcrypt"/> suitable for 32bit
block lengths. However, the author of ipcrypt has since indicated <xref target="ipcrypt-analysis"/> that it has
low security, and further analysis has revealed it is vulnerable to attack.
</t>
<t>Pseudonymization: Format-preserving, cryptographic permutation.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="bloom-filters" title="Bloom filters">
<t>van Rijswijk-Deij et al.
have recently described work using Bloom filters <xref target="Bloom-filter"/> to
categorize query traffic and record the traffic as the state of multiple
filters. The goal of this work is to allow operators to identify so-called
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) originating from specific subnets without
storing information about, or be able to monitor the DNS queries of an
individual user. By using a Bloom filter, it is possible to determine with a
high probability if, for example, a particular query was made, but the set of
queries made cannot be recovered from the filter. Similarly, by mixing queries
from a sufficient number of users in a single filter, it becomes practically
impossible to determine if a particular user performed a particular query. Large
numbers of queries can be tracked in a memory-efficient way. As filter status is
stored, this approach cannot be used to regenerate traffic, and so cannot be
used with tools used to process live traffic.
</t>
<t>Anonymized: Generalization.

<section anchor="example-drop-statement" title="Example DROP statement">
<t>The following example DROP statement is very loosely based on some elements of
published privacy statements for some public resolvers, with additional fields
populated to illustrate the what the full contents of a DROP statement might

<t>This is a purely hypothetical example of a DROP statement to outline example

collection purposes, but those counters do not maintain specific IP address
data nor is the format or model of data stored capable of being
reverse-engineered to ascertain what specific IP addresses made what
queries.</t>
<t>Data collected in logs. We do keep some generalized location information
(at the city/metropolitan area level) so that we can conduct debugging and
analyze abuse phenomena. We also use the collected information for the
creation and sharing of telemetry (timestamp, geolocation, number of hits,
first seen, last seen) for contributors, public publishing of general
statistics of system use (protections, threat types, counts, etc.)
When you use our DNS Services, here is the full list of items that are included in our logs:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Request domain name, e.g. example.net</t>
<t>Record type of requested domain, e.g. A, AAAA, NS, MX, TXT, etc.</t>
<t>Transport protocol on which the request arrived, i.e. UDP, TCP, DoT,
<vspace/>
DoH</t>
<t>Origin IP general geolocation information: i.e. geocode, region ID,
city ID, and metro code</t>
<t>IP protocol version – IPv4 or IPv6</t>
<t>Response code sent, e.g. SUCCESS, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, etc.</t>
<t>Absolute arrival time</t>
<t>Name of the specific instance that processed this request</t>
<t>IP address of the specific instance to which this request was
addressed (no relation to the requestor’s IP address)</t>
</list>
We may keep the following data as summary information, including all the
above EXCEPT for data about the DNS record requested:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Currently-advertised BGP-summarized IP prefix/netmask of apparent
client origin</t>
<t>Autonomous system number (BGP ASN) of apparent client origin</t>
</list>
All the above data may be kept in full or partial form in permanent
archives.</t>
<t>Sharing of data.
Except as described in this document, we do not intentionally share,
sell, or rent individual personal information associated with the
requestor (i.e. source IP address or any other information that can
positively identify the client using our infrastructure) with anyone
without your consent.
We generate and share high level anonymized aggregate statistics
including threat metrics on threat type, geolocation, and if available,
sector, as well as other vertical metrics including performance metrics
on our DNS Services (i.e. number of threats blocked, infrastructure
uptime) when available with our threat intelligence (TI) partners,
academic researchers, or the public.
Our DNS Services share anonymized data on specific domains queried
(records such as domain, timestamp, geolocation, number of hits, first
seen, last seen) with our threat intelligence partners. Our DNS Services
also builds, stores, and may share certain DNS data streams which store
high level information about domain resolved, query types, result codes,
and timestamp. These streams do not contain IP address information of
requestor and cannot be correlated to IP address or other PII.
We do not and never will share any of its data with marketers, nor will
it use this data for demographic analysis.</t>
</list></t>
<t>Exceptions. There are exceptions to this storage model: In the event of
actions or observed behaviors which we deem malicious or anomalous, we may
utilize more detailed logging to collect more specific IP address data in the
process of normal network defence and mitigation. This collection and
transmission off-site will be limited to IP addresses that we determine are
involved in the event.</t>
<t>Associated entities. Details of our Threat Intelligence partners can be found
at our website page (insert link).</t>
<t>Correlation of Data. We do not correlate or combine information from our logs
with any personal information that you have provided us for other services, or
with your specific IP address.</t>
<t>Result filtering.
<list style="numbers">
<t>Filtering. We utilise cyber threat intelligence about malicious domains
from a variety of public and private sources and blocks access to those
malicious domains when your system attempts to contact them. An NXDOMAIN is
returned for blocked sites.
<list style="numbers">
<t>Censorship. We will not provide a censoring component and will limit our
actions solely to the blocking of malicious domains around phishing,
malware, and exploit kit domains.</t>
<t>Accidental blocking. We implement whitelisting algorithms to make sure
legitimate domains are not blocked by accident. However, in the rare case of
blocking a legitimate domain, we work with the users to quickly whitelist
that domain. Please use our support form (insert link) if you believe we are
blocking a domain in error.</t>
