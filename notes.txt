barry green: 2 docs, informational operational component and how to handle data
paul hofffman: keep in 1 doc. timelines 
dan york: felt  that the last part DPPPPP - separate thing, different audiance, fairly static.
dkg: don't split out data management parts
lorenzo ??: hard to do document with data retention guidelines, people from different areas, laws move under us.
john reed: focussed on public clouds what about isp's particulary around ecs?
Allison: your pear group
dkg: we are not writing a legal document

[@RFC6873]????????????????

## Threat Analysis and Terminology

[Note: this section is here to clarify my thinking. It may not be in the final draft]

The following documents form the source for threats and threat terminology used in this document.

* [@RFC6973] Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols

  * Defines terms (section 3), threats (section 5) and mitigations (section 6).

  * Terms

      * Large number of terms.

  * Threats

      * Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's
      communications or activities.

      * Intrusion is described as "intrusion into one's life rather than direct intrusion into one's communications".

      * Intrusion into one's communications is considered part of the treat called Surveillance.
  
      * Stored Data Compromise

      * Misattribution

      * Correlation

      * Identification

      * Secondary Use

      * Disclosure

      * Exclusion
  
  * Mitigations

      * Data Minimization
          * Anonymity
          * Pseudonymity
          * Identity Confidentiality
          * Data Minimization within Identity Management
          * 

* [@!RFC7457] Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  and Datagram TLS (DTLS)

  * lists the attacks that motivated the current recommendations in [@!RFC7525]

* [@!RFC7525] Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)

  * Talks about the BCP for (D)TLS. In particular it discusses mitigation of  the threats in [@!RFC7457].

* [@I-D.bortzmeyer-dprive-rfc7626-bis] DNS Privacy Considerations
  
  * Discusses threats to the privacy of DNS but no solutions.

* Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  
  * This document describes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to
   provide privacy for DNS.  Encryption provided by TLS eliminates
   opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS
   queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7626.  In addition,
   this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS over TLS and
   provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead
   from using TCP and TLS with DNS.

* [@!RFC8310] Usage Profiles for DNS over TLS and DNS over DTLS
  
  * This document discusses usage profiles, based on one or more
   authentication mechanisms, which can be used for DNS over Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram TLS (DTLS).  These profiles can
   increase the privacy of DNS transactions compared to using only
   cleartext DNS.  This document also specifies new authentication
   mechanisms -- it describes several ways that a DNS client can use an
   authentication domain name to authenticate a (D)TLS connection to a
   DNS server.  Additionally, it defines (D)TLS protocol profiles for
   DNS clients and servers implementing DNS over (D)TLS.  This document
   updates RFC 7858.
